# Sally the Congressperson: The Role of Subjective Social Beliefs in Linguistic Processes

This repository contains the experiments, data, analyses, and write-ups having to do with my work on the role of individuals' subjective social beliefs in linguistic processes. The project was advised by my Qualifying Paper Committee, which consisted of Rob Podesva (Chair), Judith Degen, and Meghan Sumner.

## About the Project

Broadly, this project examines the role that individuals' subjective social beliefs about gender (e.g. whether or not it is biologically immutable) influence the way they process and produce gendered and gender-neutral terms. The items under investigation in this particular project are role nouns (Misersky et al 2014), such as 'congressperson' which mark specific social and professional positions in the world. We are particularly interested in those role nouns which show morphological marking for social gender. This can be via compounding, resulting in a ternary split, as in 'congressperson/woman/man', or it can be via affixation, resulting in a binary split, as in 'actor/actress'.

Using a self-paced reading task and a forced-choice task, we tested the role of individuals' beliefs on the reading times and selection rates of terms like ';congressperson'. We found that, in on-line processing, there was no significant effect of gender ideology, such that neither individuals' scores on Baber and Tucker's (2006) Social Roles Questionnaire nor their political affiliations significantly predicted reading times. In the forced-choice, offline task, however, there was a significant effect, such that Democrats used significantly more gender neutral forms than did Republicans. Moreover, within the Democratic party-aligned population, those with more progressive gender ideologies produced more gender-neutral forms than did their more conservative Democratic counterparts. The same pattern was not observed in the Republicans.
