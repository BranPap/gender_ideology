        Great! Now we can start the real experiment. You will now read 39 sentences. Your task is to rate how likely the individual in question is to be a woman or man. If you think they are equally likely to be of either gender, or some other non-binary gender, you can select the middle option. If you are unsure of the word's meaning, please select 'unsure' and then indicate that you do not know the term by selecting the checkbox.

        We would also like to take a minute to acknowledge takes a simplified view of gender, which does not reflect the researchers' own conceptualizations of gender. It is our hope that this work will help to inform discussion around the use of non-binary and gender-neutral language in the long run.
